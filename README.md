Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

## Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

### Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering - The systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing and maintenance of software applications.

#### Importance in the technology industry: 
1) It has enabled development of reliable and efficient softwares.
2) It has brought advancements in fields such as AI and machine learning, cloud computing, etc. Thus being a pillar in the growth of the tech industry.
3) Principles of software engineering have enabled development of scalable and maintainable softwares. This ensures that systems are able to evolve with the developments in the industry.
4) It has brought tools that have enabled digitizaton of businesses, improving efficiency of various processes as well as creation of digital products and services.
5) It has enabled creation of user-friendly softwares which has contributed to the success of many digital products and services.
 

### Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

#### 1) The Birth of High-Level Languages (1950s-1960s):
- The development of high-level programming languages such as FORTRAN (1957), COBOL (1959), and ALGOL (1958) marked a significant shift from machine-level and assembly language programming.
- These languages allowed developers to write code that was more human-readable and easier to maintain, abstracting a bulk of the complexity of hardware.
  
#### 2) The "Software Crisis" and the Birth of Software Engineering (Late 1960s):
- The term "software engineering" was coined at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968, in response to the so-called "software crisis."
- This crisis was characterized by frequent project overruns, budget excesses, and the delivery of unreliable software.
- This milestone pushed the need for structured methodologies, and more planned approaches to software development.

#### 3) The Rise of Structured and Object-Oriented Programming (1970s-1990s):
- This era saw the development of structured programming techniques, which emphasized modularity and top-down design through languages like C.
- Later, object-oriented programming (OOP) emerged, with languages like C++ and Java.
- OOP promoted code reusability, maintainability, and a better way of modeling real-world systems.

#### 4) The Rise of Agile Methodologies (2001):
- The Agile Manifesto, published in 2001, marked a paradigm shift in software development.
- It emphasized flexibility, customer collaboration, and iterative progress over rigid planning and documentation.


### List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
1) Planning - The planning phase typically includes tasks like cost-benefit analysis, scheduling, resource estimation, and allocation.
2) Design - In the design phase, software engineers analyze requirements and identify the best solutions to create the software.
3) Implementation - In the implementation phase, the development team codes the product. They analyze the requirements to identify smaller coding tasks they can do daily to achieve the final result.
4) Testing - The development team combines automation and manual testing to check the software for bugs.
5) Deployment - The software is deployed to the production environment, making it available to end-users.
6) Maintenance - Involves providing support, fixing bugs, and implementing updates and enhancements to the software.


### Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


# Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
