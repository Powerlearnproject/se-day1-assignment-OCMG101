### B) Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

#### 1) The Birth of High-Level Languages (1950s-1960s):
- The development of high-level programming languages such as FORTRAN (1957), COBOL (1959), and ALGOL (1958) marked a significant shift from machine-level and assembly language programming.
- These languages allowed developers to write code that was more human-readable and easier to maintain, abstracting a bulk of the complexity of hardware.
  
#### 2) The "Software Crisis" and the Birth of Software Engineering (Late 1960s):
- The term "software engineering" was coined at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968, in response to the so-called "software crisis."
- This crisis was characterized by frequent project overruns, budget excesses, and the delivery of unreliable software.
- This milestone pushed the need for structured methodologies, and more planned approaches to software development.

#### 3) The Rise of Structured and Object-Oriented Programming (1970s-1990s):
- This era saw the development of structured programming techniques, which emphasized modularity and top-down design through languages like C.
- Later, object-oriented programming (OOP) emerged, with languages like C++ and Java.
- OOP promoted code reusability, maintainability, and a better way of modeling real-world systems.

#### 4) The Rise of Agile Methodologies (2001):
- The Agile Manifesto, published in 2001, marked a paradigm shift in software development.
- It emphasized flexibility, customer collaboration, and iterative progress over rigid planning and documentation.

### C) List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
1) Planning/Requirements - The planning phase typically includes tasks like cost-benefit analysis, scheduling, resource estimation, and allocation.
2) Design - In the design phase, software engineers analyze requirements and identify the best solutions to create the software.
3) Implementation - In the implementation phase, the development team codes the product. They analyze the requirements to identify smaller coding tasks they can do daily to achieve the final result.
4) Testing - The development team combines automation and manual testing to check the software for bugs.
5) Deployment - The software is deployed to the production environment, making it available to end-users.
6) Maintenance - Involves providing support, fixing bugs, and implementing updates and enhancements to the software.

---

### Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
#### 1) Waterfall:
- It is a linear and sequential approach where each phase of the SDLC is completed before moving on to the next.
- Extensive documentation is created at each phase, and changes are difficult to implement once a phase is completed.
- Examples of appropriate scenarios:
  a) Developing a government system with well-defined regulations and requirements.
  b) Healthcare systems where extensive documentation and compliance are required.

#### 2) Agile:
- It is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
- Emphasizes collaboration between cross-functional teams and stakeholders.
- It is highly adaptive to changing requirements.
- Examples of appropriate scenarios:
  a) Developing a new mobile app where user feedback and market trends can significantly influence the product.
  b) Complex projects such as software for financial services where requirements may evolve based on regulatory changes or market conditions.

### D) Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1) Software Developer - Writes code and implements software solutions.
2) Quality Assurance Engineer - Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
3) Project Manager - Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software development projects.

---

### E) Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1) IDEs
- Provide tools for writing, debugging, and testing code.
- Provide real-time error detection, code analysis, and refactoring tools, helping developers write cleaner and more maintainable code.
- Examples include: VS Code, PyCharm, Eclipse.
  
2) VCS
- Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members.
- Enable multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, without overwriting each other's changes.
- Examples include: Git, Subversion.

---

### F) What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
#### Challenges:
1) Tight Deadlines and Pressure - Software development projects often have tight deadlines, leading to stress and burnout.
2) Ever-Evolving Technologies - Constant changes in the industry, require engineers to continuously learn new languages, frameworks, and tools; which can be difficult to keep up with.
3) Challenges in performance optimization - Ensuring that software performs well under various conditions, including high load and limited resources, can be challenging.

#### Solutions:
1) Effective planning and proper time management in order to maximize productivity and organization.
2) Dedicating time for learning through online courses, tutorials, and conferences as well as followong industry blogs, publications, and social media to keep track of emerging trends.
3) Apply optimization techniques such as caching, load balancing, and database indexing to improve performance.

### G) Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1) Unit Testing:
   - Testing individual components or modules of software.
   - Helps to identify bugs early in the development process, making them easier and cheaper to fix.
     
2) Integration Testing:
   - Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
   - Ensures that the interfaces between different components are working correctly.
     
3) System Testing:
   - Testing the entire software system as a whole.
   - Verifies that the system functions correctly from end to end.
     
4) Acceptance Testing:
   - Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
   -  Ensures that the software meets the user's needs and expectations.
  

## Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


### A) Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering - The designing of specific, clear, and well-structured inputs (prompts) that guide AI models to generate the intended results.

#### Importance: 
- Improves Output Quality -  Well-crafted prompts help AI models generate more accurate and relevant responses.
- Reduces Ambiguity - Clear and precise prompts minimize misunderstandings, enabling the AI to better understand the intent behind the prompt and provide more useful responses.
- Enables Specialization - By tailoring prompts, users can leverage AI models for specialized tasks, such as creative writing, technical problem-solving, or customer support.

### B) Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- Vague prompt: Write python code.
- Improved prompt: Write a Python function to generate the Fibonacci Sequence up to 18 terms using recursion.
- The improved promt clearly defines the task (generating the Fibonacci Sequence) and specifies the method (recursion) and the limit (18 terms).
